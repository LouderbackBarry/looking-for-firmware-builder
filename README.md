# looking-for-firmware-builder
i upgraded my 3D printer Creality CR-10 S5 put in; Big Tree Tech SKR Mini E3 V3 mainboard, Micro Swiss Direct drive feeding, Dragon Fly hotend with cartridge style thermistor similar to e3d that can read temperature up to 500 celsius, 12 volt 70 watt heating cartridge to get up to 500 celsius, i upgrade hotbed to get up to 180 celsius and heat the whole bed because original hot bed was junk, the 3D printer is a 12 volt system. i upgraded it so i can 3D print with all filaments and even make my own my only problem is i dont know how to build firmware, trying find someone i can pay to do it for me i do know how to install firmware from my Slicer. right now my CR-10 S5 is running like an ender 3 because thats what Big Tree Tech has on board and said to get on github and i cant find the firmware i need on github
